## API Overview

Ollama provides several ways to interact with models:

1. **Ollama API**: A REST API for running models, generating completions, and managing your Ollama installation
2. **OpenAI-compatible API**: An API that follows the OpenAI format, making it easy to use Ollama with existing tools and libraries
3. **Modelfile**: A configuration format for creating and customizing models

## Getting Started with the API

If you're new to the Ollama API, we recommend starting with the [API Reference](api.md) to learn about the available endpoints and how to use them.

For those familiar with OpenAI's API, check out the [OpenAI Compatibility](openai.md) guide to see how you can use Ollama with existing OpenAI-based tools and code.

If you want to create or customize models, the [Modelfile Reference](modelfile.md) provides detailed information on the available options and syntax.
